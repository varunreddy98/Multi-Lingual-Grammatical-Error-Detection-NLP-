When	c	i
I	c	i

it	c	i
was	c	i
nearly	c	c
impossible	c	i
to	c	i
have	c	i
them	c	i

I	c	i
felt	c	c
lack	i	i

bought	c	i
a	c	c

It	c	i
was	c	i
so	i	i
necessary	c	i

I	c	i
wanted	c	i
to	c	i

I	c	i
can	c	i
live	c	i
without	c	c
this	c	c
.	c	c

In	i	c
our	i	c
lifes	i	i
,	i	c
may	i	c
be	i	i
,	i	c
could	i	i
n't	i	i
be	i	c
without	i	c
electricity	i	i

Some	c	c
people	c	c
can	c	i
live	c	c
without	c	i
this	c	c
,	c	c
but	c	i
I	c	i
am	c	c
sure	c	c
that	c	c
the	c	c
world	c	c
would	c	c
be	c	i
very	c	c
different	c	i
.	c	c

When	c	c
we	c	i
are	i	i
using	i	i
different	c	i
equipments	i	i
in	c	c
our	c	i
houses	i	i
,	c	c
we	c	i
are	c	i
using	c	i
the	i	i
electricity	c	i
.	c	c

Small	i	i
things	i	i
but	i	i
very	i	i
importants	i	i
in	i	c
our	i	i
lifes	i	i
.	i	i

For	i	i
example	i	i
:	i	i
T.V.	i	i
,	i	c
computer	i	c
,	i	c
just	i	i
light	i	i
and	i	c
a	i	c
long	i	i
list	i	i
that	i	c
now	i	c
I	i	i
can	i	i
not	i	c
write	i	c
.	c	i

I	c	i
do	c	i
n't	c	i
like	c	i
tinking	i	i
,	i	i
my	c	i
house	c	i
of	i	i
my	c	i
life	c	c
,	i	c
without	c	i
all	c	i
this	i	i
facilities	c	i
.	c	i

In	c	c
winter	c	c
when	i	c
is	i	i
dark	i	i
very	i	c
early	i	c
,	i	c
and	i	c
after	i	i
,	i	c
I	i	i
need	i	i
to	i	i
spent	i	i
my	i	i
free	i	c
time	i	c
in	i	c
home	i	i
.	c	i

What	c	i
I	i	i
can	i	i
do	c	i
without	c	c
my	c	i
music	c	c
and	c	c
my	c	i
computer	c	c
.	i	i

Now	c	c
,	c	c
just	i	i
you	i	i
need	c	i
to	c	i
think	c	c
that	i	c
you	i	i
would	i	c
do	i	i
or	i	c
what	i	c
would	i	c
happen	i	i
in	i	c
a	i	c
city	i	c
,	i	c
with	i	c
a	i	c
car	i	i
,	i	c
aeroplans	i	i
,	i	c
shoops	i	i
,	i	c
all	i	i
these	i	i
things	i	i
without	i	i
lights	i	c
.	c	i

Finally	c	i
.	i	i

I	c	i
think	c	c
that	c	c
everybody	c	c
know	i	i
that	c	c
the	i	i
electricity	c	i
is	c	c
very	i	c
important	c	c
invent	i	c
and	c	c
for	c	c
me	c	c
it	c	c
is	c	c
the	c	i
best	c	i

As	c	c
for	c	i
the	c	c
last	c	i

I	i	i
would	c	c
suggest	c	c
you	c	i
to	i	c

a	c	c

Yours	c	c
Sincerely	i	c
,	c	c

I	c	i
always	c	i
had	c	c
consider	i	i
myself	c	i
been	i	c
very	c	c
looky	i	c
to	c	i
be	c	i
born	c	i
in	c	i
the	c	i
Century	i	i
because	c	c
all	i	c
the	c	i
amaizing	i	i
human	c	c
inventions	c	i
.	c	i

As	c	i
an	c	i
example	c	c
let	c	i
's	c	c
have	c	c
a	c	c
look	c	c
and	c	c
we	c	c
will	c	c
see	c	c
of	i	c
this	c	c
nation	c	c
how	i	c
it	c	i
has	c	i
developed	c	i
.	c	i

We	c	c
just	c	i
need	c	i
to	c	i
think	c	c
about	c	c
the	c	c
first	c	i
world	c	i
wold	i	i
and	c	c
all	c	c
the	c	i
inventions	c	i
created	c	i
thanks	c	i
to	c	i
the	c	i
industrial	c	i
revolution	c	i
to	i	i
these	i	i
day	i	c
.	c	i

However	c	i
I	i	i
feel	c	c
that	c	c
at	c	i
the	c	c
moment	c	i
there	c	i
should	c	i
emerge	c	c
more	c	i
grups	i	i
to	c	i
control	c	i
this	c	c
development	c	c
because	c	c
the	i	c
industrial	c	c
polution	i	i
that	c	c
it	i	c
has	c	c
been	c	c
created	c	i
and	c	c
it	c	c
seems	c	c
that	c	c
its	i	c
very	c	c
little	c	c
what	i	i
has	i	i
been	i	c
done	i	i
at	c	i
the	c	i
moment	c	i
in	c	c
relation	c	c
to	c	c
our	c	c
embiroment	i	c
.	c	i

I	c	i
hope	c	c
in	c	c
the	c	c
future	c	c
there	c	c
will	c	c
be	c	c
more	c	c
and	c	c
more	c	c
people	c	c
interested	c	c
in	c	c
this	c	c
important	c	c
issue	c	c
.	c	i

I	c	i
am	c	c
writing	c	c
in	c	c
reply	c	c
to	c	c
your	c	i
enquiry	c	c
about	c	c
this	c	c
year	i	c
international	c	c
conference	c	c
.	c	c

The	c	c
conference	c	c
will	c	c
be	c	c
held	c	c
at	c	i
The	c	c
Palace	c	i
Hotel	c	c
on	c	c
Old	c	c

There	c	c
will	c	c
be	c	c

Central	i	c
train	c	c

The	c	c

.	c	i

Light	i	c
lunch	c	c
will	c	c
be	c	c
provided	c	c
.	c	c

After	c	c
the	c	c
conference	c	c
,	c	c
there	c	c
will	c	c
be	c	c
a	c	c
relaxing	c	c
party	c	c
.	c	i

There	c	c
is	c	c
no	c	c
dressed-code	i	c
for	c	c
the	c	c
party	c	i
.	c	c

However	c	i
I	i	i
suggest	c	i
you	c	i
could	i	c
wear	c	c
the	c	c
same	c	c
outfit	c	c
as	i	c
you	c	i
wear	i	c
for	c	c
the	c	c
conference	c	c
.	c	c

I	c	i
have	c	i
included	c	c
the	i	c
local	c	c
map	c	c
,	i	c
there	i	i
are	c	i
some	c	i
ideas	i	c
at	i	c
the	c	c
back	c	c
of	c	c
the	c	c
map	c	c
.	c	c

Please	c	c
let	c	c
me	c	i
know	c	c
if	c	c
you	c	i
would	c	c
like	c	c
to	c	c
book	c	c
one	c	c
of	c	c
the	c	c
city-walk	c	c
tours	c	c
,	i	c
We	c	c
have	c	c
arrange	i	c
spacial	i	c
discounts	c	i
for	c	c
the	c	c
conference	c	c
attendance	i	c
.	c	c

Personly	i	i
I	c	i
recommend	c	c
the	c	c
Dicken	i	c
's	i	c
tour	c	c
because	c	c
it	c	c
is	c	c
a	c	c
good	c	c
length	c	c
of	i	c
walking	i	c
and	c	c
very	c	c
historical	c	i
.	c	c

I	c	i
hope	c	c
that	c	c
I	c	i
have	c	c
covered	c	c
all	c	c
information	i	c
you	c	i
would	i	c
need	c	c
and	c	c
look	c	c
forward	c	c
to	c	c
seeing	c	c
you	c	i
.	c	i

P.S.	c	c
Please	c	i
find	c	c
the	c	c
enclosed	i	c
map	i	c
.	c	c

There	c	i
are	c	i
several	c	c
interesting	c	c
buildings	c	c
in	c	c
the	c	c
city	c	c
of	c	c
London	c	c
.	c	c

I	c	c
believe	c	c
Liverpool	c	c
Street	c	c
Station	c	c
is	c	c
at	c	c
the	c	c
top	c	i
list	i	i
.	c	c

The	c	c
building	c	c
itself	c	c
looks	c	c
grand	c	i
and	c	c
elegant	c	i
.	c	i

Despite	c	i
the	c	c
fact	c	c
that	c	c
this	c	c
building	c	c
has	i	c
served	i	i
half-a	i	c
million	c	c
commuters	c	i
in	c	c
a	c	c
day	c	c
,	c	c
it	c	c
always	i	c
clean	c	c
and	c	c
functional	c	c
.	c	i

There	c	c
are	c	c
two	c	c
parts	c	c
of	c	c
Liverpool	c	c
Street	c	c
Station	c	c
that	c	c
make	c	c
it	c	c
so	c	c
interesting	c	c
building	i	c
.	c	c

The	c	c
newly	c	c
decorated	c	c
section	c	c
is	c	c
fairly	c	c
modern	c	c
style	i	c
with	c	c
escalators	c	c
and	c	c
touched-screen	i	c
ticket	c	c
machine	i	c
.	c	c

It	c	c
is	c	c
also	c	c
very	c	c
well	c	c
linked	c	c
into	i	c
the	c	c
old	c	i
underground	c	c
station	c	c
which	i	c
it	i	c
is	c	c
such	c	c
a	c	c
contrast	c	c
in	c	c
transformation	i	c
.	c	c

The	c	c
old	c	c
bit	c	c
is	c	c
rather	c	c
unique	c	c
and	c	c
charming	c	i
.	c	c

You	c	i
could	i	c
really	c	c
imagine	c	c
how	i	c
it	c	c
looked	c	c
like	c	c
in	c	c
the	i	c
old	i	i
day	i	c
.	c	c

At	c	c
the	c	c
far	c	c
back	i	c
of	c	c
the	c	c
station	c	c
is	i	c
also	i	c
connected	c	c
to	c	c
a	c	c
spacious	c	c
well	i	c
designed	i	c
pedestrians	i	c
park	c	c
.	c	c

It	c	c
is	c	c
a	c	c
good	c	c
example	c	c
of	c	c
a	i	c
great	c	i
architecture	c	c
that	c	c
was	c	i
designed	c	c
to	c	i
provide	c	i
services	c	i
to	i	i
the	c	i
public	c	c
.	c	i

Finally	c	c
,	c	c
it	c	c
is	c	c
in	c	c
the	c	c
heart	c	c
of	c	c
city	i	c
and	c	c
everyone	i	c
would	i	c
be	i	c
able	i	i
to	i	c
find	i	i
without	i	c
doubt	i	c
.	c	c

I	c	c
am	c	c
glad	c	c
to	c	i
helping	i	c
you	c	i
for	i	c
the	c	c
organisation	c	c
of	c	c
the	c	c
international	c	c
student	c	c
conference	c	c
.	c	c

The	c	c
group	c	c
has	c	c
been	c	c
booked	c	c
into	c	c
the	c	c
Palace	c	i
Hotel	c	c
,	c	c
and	c	c
the	c	i
best	c	i
way	c	i
to	c	i
get	c	i
from	c	i
there	c	i
to	c	c
the	c	c
conference	c	c
is	c	c
by	c	c
tube	c	c
,	i	c
the	i	c
building	i	c
of	c	c
the	c	c
conference	c	c
is	c	c
then	c	c
five	c	c
minutes	c	i
by	c	c
footh	i	c
.	c	c

At	c	c
the	c	c
end-of-conference	i	c
there	c	c
is	c	c
a	c	c
party	c	i
,	c	c
where	c	c
we	c	c
can	c	c
eat	c	c
something	c	c
,	c	c
dance	c	c
and	c	c
speak	c	c
to	c	i
each	c	c
other	c	i
about	c	c
the	c	c
conference	c	c
.	c	i

For	c	c
the	c	c
party	c	c
I	c	i
suggest	c	i
you	c	i
to	i	i
wear	i	c
classic	c	i
clothes	c	c
;	c	c
maybe	c	i
something	c	c
black	c	c
and	c	c
not	c	i
red	c	c
or	c	c
pink	c	c
.	c	c

I	c	i
am	c	c
going	c	c
to	c	i
wear	c	c
black	i	c
classic	i	i
trousers	c	c
and	c	c
a	c	c
white	c	c
jorsey	i	c
-	c	c
it	c	c
can	i	c
be	c	c
that	c	c
this	c	c
information	c	c
give	i	i
you	c	i
some	c	c
idea	c	c
too.	c	c
.	i	c

On	c	c
the	c	c
last	c	i
day	c	c
we	c	c
are	c	c
going	c	c
to	c	i
have	c	c
about	c	i
three	c	c
hours	i	c
free	c	c
times	i	c
.	c	c

What	c	c
do	c	c
you	c	i
think	c	c
if	i	c
we	i	c
will	i	c
go	i	c
to	c	c
visit	i	c
the	c	c
Arts	c	c
Museum	c	c
?	c	c

Of	i	c
if	i	c
we	c	c
will	i	c
go	c	c
to	c	i
hear	c	c
a	c	c
classic	c	c
concert	c	c
near	c	c
the	c	c
conference	c	c
building	i	c
's	i	c
?	i	c

I	c	c
hope	c	c
that	c	c
I	c	i
have	c	c
been	c	c
able	c	c
to	c	c
give	c	c
you	c	i
some	c	c
help.	c	c
and	i	c
I	c	c
am	c	c
looking	c	c
forward	c	c
to	c	c
seeing	c	c
you	c	i
at	c	c

conference	c	c

I	c	i
am	c	c
writing	c	c
a	c	c
report	c	c

which	i	c
will	i	c
describe	c	c
you	i	i
the	c	c
